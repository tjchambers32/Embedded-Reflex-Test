An exploration of the Model Conductor Hardware architecture and Test Driven Development in Embedded C 

## What does this code do?

Right now, nothing. In the end, we'll be creating a simple game to test your reflexes. As different colors appear on the screen, a player will need to press a corresponding button as fast as they can.

## What is this repository for?

We're learning the concepts of Test Driven Development for embedded systems by following the Model Conductor Hardware architecture established [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1Phjj5PHLKleWJZNl8tV1pmZEk/view?usp=sharing). We'll be drawing from examples created by ThrowTheSwitch in [this](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/CMock) repo.
